        <h2>A Love of The Sea</h2>
        <article>The sea has always called to me. Being able to navigate the seas was aways a dream of mind. However, even on dry land I would
            like to show my love of the sea and the slight rebel side of this Sailor.

        <h2>Pirate Things</h2>
        <section>While the I have always wanted to sail the seas, I never could decide on how I would get there. I was sure like in my favorite
            anime, <i>One Piece</i>, that I would sail at some point but that was a problem for the future. I did join the United State of America's
            Navy and became a Sailor. I may not have been as cool as Commander Chandler, but I did wear the same uniform. At least for a time.
